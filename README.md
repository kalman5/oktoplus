###### What is oktoplus
Oktoplus is a in-memory data store K:V where V is a container: std::list, std::map, boost::multi_index_container, std::set, you name it. Doing so the client can choose the best container for his own access data pattern.

If this reminds you of REDIS then you are right, I was inspired by it, however:

 - Redis is not multithread
 - Redis offers only basic containers
 - For instance the Redis command LINDEX is O(n), so if you need to access a value with an index would be better to use a Vector style container
  - There is no analogue of multi-set in Redis

Redis Commands Compatibility

  - [LISTS](docs/compatibility_lists.md) 76% Completed
  - [SETS](docs/compatibility_sets.md) 18% Completed
  - [STRINGS](docs/compatibility_strings.md) 0% Completed
  
**Oktoplus** specific containers (already implemented, see specific documentation)

  - [DEQUES](docs/deques.md)
  - [VECTORS](docs/vectors.md)
  
The server exports a Grpc interface (https://grpc.io/). Refer to src/Libraries/Commands/commands.proto to see the exported interface, you can use it to build a client for your favourite language. 

Server is multithread, two different clients working on different containers (type or name) have a minimal interaction. For example multiple clients performing a parallel batch insert on different keys can procede in parallel without blocking each other.

#### Road Map
- Support all REDIS commands (at least the one relative to data storage)
- Support the following containers: deque, list, map, multimap, multiset, set, unorderd_map, unordered_multimap, vector, boost::multi_index (up to at least 3 keys)
- Make it distributed using RAFT as consensus protocol
